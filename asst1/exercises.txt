1)Assume that the residents of Podunk are exceptional and follow the old (and widely ignored) convention that whoever arrives at the intersection first proceeds first. Using the language of synchronization primitives describe the way this intersection is controlled. In what ways is this method suboptimal?
-The intersection is controlled by letting only one car have access to the lock for the intersection at a time.
-The method is suboptimal because, whoever comes first goes first. 
The second one cannot go until the first one finishes. 
This will not utilize the resources at its fullest. 
For example, vehicle coming from route A is turning right using resource AB and vehicle coming from route B making right using resource BC. 
So, vehicle from route A and B can independently pass the intersection at the same time without having to interfere one another. 
But, if vehicle B must wait for the vehicle from route A to complete its turn, resources that are unused by A is not utilized. Hence, it is not optimal. 



2)Now, assume that the residents of Podunk are like most people and do not follow the convention described above. In what one instance can this three-way-stop intersection produce a deadlock? (It will be helpful to think of this in terms of the model we are using instead of trying to visualize an actual intersection).

-Assume that three vehicles approach at the intersection from all three intersection at the same time:
Vehicle coming from route A intents to make left puts a lock on AB and waits for the lock BC. 
Vehicle coming from route B intents to make left puts a lock on BC and waits for the lock CA.
Vehicle coming from route C intents to make left puts a lock on CA and waits for the lock AB.
As you can see above every vehicle is waiting for another lock to be free which causes a deadlock.
